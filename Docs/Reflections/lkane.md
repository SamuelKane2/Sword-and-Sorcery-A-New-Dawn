Project Reflection

Levi Kane
Sprint 1:
Our project planning was a little behind, but we eventually got it done in the end. I think that this is going to be a very generic game, but it will be good, as long as we finish it. 

Sprint 2:
So far I have completed the tilemap, along with starting the inventory for the player. I wasted a couple days trying to make it so that when a house is clicked, that person doesn't have to select all of the certain tiles, but just click on he house for the entire house. I should've have just left it there so that people who needed the tilemap for what they were doing could get it. I also should've asked Brenden next to me because he fixed something with the tilemap right after I finished it. I am suprised at how easy it was to create the design for the inventory, I hope that I get it done next sprint.

Sprint 3:
I was sick the first week from Tuesday to Friday, so I missed school and didn't work on it on the weekend. Then there was Thanksgiving break from Wednesday to Friday, which I also didn't work on it. Now I am behind and need to catch up and finish the inventory so that I can move onto something else. The tutorial that I am following has the player pick up items in a different way to mine, I am trying to get it to work, but I can't so far.

Sprint 4:
I am still not done with the inventory and should've just looked at her other tutorials to figure out how she used the items to pick up instead of the player. I need to finish it this weekend along with some other things so that we don't get a horrible grade on the project. The most annoying thing when following a tutorial is that I get one little tiny thing wrong, it breaks the game, and I spend an hour or two looking everywhere for it. I also spent a ton of time trying to figure out how to make her method work with my way of picking items up, I should've just looked at her other tutorials to figure out exactly how she did it. These are the things that waste the most time, and is one of the reasons I haven't finished the inventory yet.

Final Thoughts:
I wish that I got more done on this project, I am dissapointed that we didn't get very far completing it. Brayden was a nuisance because he would get angry very fast and distract half the class. I think he was working on the enemies, this entire time. He isn't even the one who got them to move, Jerry did it. However, for the first bit, he would argue sometimes with Jerry, but it wasn't that bad. As the deadline drifted closer, especially that last week, he did it more and more. I wish that we were more coordinated and talked more to figure out what each team member was going to complete that sprint so that we could stay on track to actually finish the project in time. I should have learned from my previous projects (in which I had to work a ton the last week in order to actually finish it) and work on it much more at home.
