Sprint 1:
Planning out the project went well but we were a little beheid and honetsly some more resaerch was needed to see if we could've added a bit more, but when this game is finally over it should be a pretty good and genaric game.

Sprint 2:
I tried to complet the Charater but for some reason the animation tree isn't working right and I've been trying to look up videos around it but it has been dificult for me to figure it out.

Sprint 3:
This sprint I worked on tryiong to fix the knight until Jerry (shout out to him) made a charater that wasn't as messed up as mine and was actually really solid. After this I focused on trying to write a health system that could be used with eneimes and characters but it also was a bit funky.

Sprint 4:
I psuhed some stuff up to main I shouldn't have and then most of this entire sprint was focused on doing anything I could that wasn't messing with code or just simply trying to fix the main. 

Final Thoughts:
Throughtout this project I have leaned many things and honestly have become a better coder in many diffrent ways. I would say I also learned how bad Github can be but also how helpful it can be too. This project was a lot of fun and I wish I put more effort into it. I liked my group and for the most part we all worked toghther good.
