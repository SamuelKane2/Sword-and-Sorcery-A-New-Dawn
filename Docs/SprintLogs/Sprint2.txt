Completed Tasks:
-Levi - Tilemap
-Brenden - Built the actual world
Jerry - Player character

Roadblocks:
-Josh thought he was the only one developing the character, but Jerry already finished it.

Pivots:
-Make sure that everybody knows that everybody else is doing so that we don't have two people developing the character at the same time, which wastes time

Concerns:
- Getting the project fully completed
